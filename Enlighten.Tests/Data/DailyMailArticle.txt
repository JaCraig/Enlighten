A Colorado man has won the lottery twice in one day after playing the same numbers for 30 years.
Colorado Lottery officials identified 'Joe B' as the winner of two $1 million Powerball prizes in Pueblo on March 25.  

'Joe likes to play one play of his own numbers, and a couple more plays with Quick Picks,' a story on the Colorado Lottery website explained. 

'He bought a few Powerball plays in the morning at 7-Eleven on 926 Lake Ave, then stopped and bought a few more plays in the evening at Loaf N' Jug on 2050 Lake Ave.'  

The venues are about a mile apart.

'Joe B' finally collected his winnings on Monday, a month after playing the lucky numbers.

The Colorado Lottery received approval earlier this month to process winning tickets worth $10,000 or more at a touch-free, drive-thru claims office amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Winners must make an appointment to claim their prize, or do so through the mail.

Joe B was pictured holding large versions of his checks to partially conceal his face as he posed for a picture at the drive-thru.

'Can you believe what amazing luck!' the Colorado Lottery website asks.

'When the claims staff asked what he and his wife plan to spend the money on, he said, "the Boss has plans for it",' the website added. 

As of Tuesday there were more than 14,000 COVID-19 cases in Colorado and more than 730 deaths. In Pueblo County there were 136 cases and nine deaths.

Pueblo has proved a lucky place to be recently as a $2million winning Powerball ticket was sold at Alta Convenience on Wednesday. 

The same day a Powerball ticket worth $1million was purchased from Fontaine in the nearby Colorado Springs. In Colorado Springs' El Paso County there were 884 coronavirus cases and 69 deaths as of Tuesday. 

The next Powerball drawing is on Wednesday with an estimated jackpot of $43million and a cash value of $35.3million.
